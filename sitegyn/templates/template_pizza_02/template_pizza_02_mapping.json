For every business, you MUST structure `content_json` so that the website feels complete and rich.

At a MINIMUM, the `content_json` for a small local business website must include:

- Hero section:
  - 1 strong main headline (not just 2–3 words, but a full, meaningful sentence).
  - 1 short subheadline (1–2 sentences).
  - 1 clear primary call-to-action text (CTA).

- About / Why-us section:
  - At least 2–3 short paragraphs that explain who the business is, what they do, and why they are different.
  - At least 3 concrete “reasons to choose us” (each with a short title + 1–2 sentence explanation).

- Services / Menu / Products section:
  - At least 5–8 items (for example: menu items, services, or packages).
  - For each item: a clear name + 1 short description sentence.
  - If relevant, you may also add a simple price or price range text.

- Contact / Order section:
  - 1 strong title that invites the visitor to contact or order.
  - 1–2 sentences that explain how to get in touch or place an order.
  - A clear call-to-action phrase (for example: “Call now”, “Order on WhatsApp”, “Book an appointment”).
  - A simple “opening hours” line with realistic hours if none were provided.

You MUST never stop at only one heading and one paragraph.
Always generate enough copy so that the page feels full and commercially useful.
It is OK if some of this content is not used by the template. The important thing is that no section feels empty or too short.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT – TEMPLATE PLACEHOLDERS

To make sure the website builder can inject your copy into different HTML templates, you must also include inside `content_json` a flat object called `"placeholders"`.

This object MUST contain ready-to-use text values for all template placeholders that the site might need.

Example structure (simplified):

"content_json": {
  "placeholders": {
    "logo_title": "...",
    "eyebrow_text": "...",
    "home_hero_title": "...",
    "home_hero_paragraph": "...",
    "home_hero_cta": "...",
    "why_us_title": "...",
    "why_us_subtitle": "...",
    "feature_1_title": "...",
    "feature_1_text": "...",
    "feature_2_title": "...",
    "feature_2_text": "...",
    "feature_3_title": "...",
    "feature_3_text": "...",
    "menu_section_title": "...",
    "menu_section_subtitle": "...",
    "menu_item_1_name": "...",
    "menu_item_1_price": "...",
    "menu_item_1_desc": "...",
    "menu_item_2_name": "...",
    "menu_item_2_price": "...",
    "menu_item_2_desc": "...",
    "menu_item_3_name": "...",
    "menu_item_3_price": "...",
    "menu_item_3_desc": "...",
    "contact_title": "...",
    "contact_subtitle": "...",
    "cta_whatsapp": "...",
    "opening_hours": "..."
  },

  "... other structured sections like hero, about, services, contact ..."
}

For pizza restaurants you MUST always fill **all** of the placeholders above with real marketing copy (not just 1–2 words).

After **each** answer (after Question 1 and again after Question 2) you MUST regenerate the full `"placeholders"` object so that it reflects the user’s current main goal and overwrites any previous values.
